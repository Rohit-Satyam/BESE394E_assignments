## Common Assignment
**1.  Why transcriptomics is used as cornerstone to the different multiome technologies?**

***Response:***  The RNA sits at the center of the Central Dogma as can be seen below.

This gives us advantage to quantify the effect of things that goes upstream (at DNA level) and relate it with the phenotype we observe. At the end of the day, we want to know and quantify how an epigenetic modification/ open chromatin/ close chromatin/ Transcription facter/ Enhancer/ Repressor/ methylation affect the gene transcription which we use as a proxy to protein exprerssion levels and therefore explaining the phenotype. The other reason could be because it is cheap to do and easy to pair up with other omic studies.

**2.  Does focusing on single cells within the context of multiomic data provide a complete picture of biological processes, or are there important aspects that this approach might miss?**
    
***Response:***  It does to some extent but thatâ€™s not the end of the road. Using single cells in multi-omics significantly improves our understanding of biological processes and cellular diversity and rare cell types while providing insights that were previously unattainable with bulk analyses. However, we do it at some cost.

- For instance, spatial context is lost which might not be so
    important when you deal with parasites (like apicomplexans) but
    might be important when you are trying to study tumor or bacterial
    microenvironment that largely affect behaviour of the neighbouring
    cells.
- We also miss capturing a lot of genes (lowely expressed genes) due to technical limitations of the technology and that might give us half or even distorted picture of the actual biology.
- With a higher resolution comes the risk of mistaking noise as a true biological signal which is difficult to tease apart. Coupling
    multiple omic technologies might also lead to more confusion and
    misinterpretation.

    
**3. How might the future of multiomic single-cell technology contribute to our understanding of complex biological phenomena?**
    

***Response:*** The multiomic single-cell technology has wide range of applications. It has application on both basic research level and translatory research level.

  

1.  At basic research level, multiomics is helping us in finding new cell types in our body about which we were unaware of and is also helping us study the temporal dynamics that leads to their formation, propagation and death. This is mostly the first step where we are trying to catalogue the cellular diversity. Other than that, it also helps us identify diagnostic markers for cell types which can improve disease prognosis and also helps us study drug-resistance at cellular level.
    
2.  At the translational level, drug discovery and personalised medicine are two of the fields that are expected to grow. People visiting cancer clinic might have different tumor architecture and might be at different stages of cancer. Following similar treatment regimen on all patients might not improve the survival outcomes for everyone as we know. Spatial multiomics can help doctors study the tumor progression and can help make medical decision for patient treatment.
